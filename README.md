# Django-Flashcards-App
A flashcard app using Python and the Django framework. The goal os this project is to create a full-stack web app that replicates a spaced recognition repetition system which is also called the Leitner system.  

In Leitner system, flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the learner knows each card in the box. The learner will try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If succeed, the card will be sent to the next group; if fail, card will be sent back to the first group. There are evidence to proof that spaced repetition helps to boost learning potential. 

This project is inspired by [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/django-flashcards-app/#demo-your-django-flashcards-app).
